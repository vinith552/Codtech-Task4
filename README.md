2. *Ease of Use*:  
   - The interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to manage tasks effortlessly.  
   - The Edit and Delete buttons are clearly labeled and functional.

3. *Real-Time Updates*:  
   - Task list updates immediately after any operation, providing a seamless user experience.  

4. *Error Handling*:  
   - Ensures tasks cannot be empty by validating user input.  
   - Prompts the user to confirm edits and handles empty edits gracefully.

5. *Code Structure*:  
   - The code is modular and well-organized, with functions clearly dedicated to specific tasks.  
   - Use of local storage is efficient and ensures the app remains lightweight.

### Improvement Suggestions:

1. *UI/UX Enhancements*:  
   - Add animations for adding, editing, or deleting tasks for a smoother experience.  
   - Allow users to press "Enter" to add a task instead of clicking the "Add Task" button.  

2. *Task Completion Feature*:  
   - Add checkboxes to mark tasks as complete and visually differentiate them (e.g., strikethrough text).

3. *Prioritization*:  
   - Allow users to set task priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low) and sort tasks based on priority.

4. *Filter and Search*:  
   - Implement a search bar to quickly find tasks.  
   - Add filtering options (e.g., show only completed or pending tasks).

5. *Mobile Optimization*:  
   - Ensure the application is responsive and works well on smaller screens.

6. *Confirmation for Deletion*:  
   - Add a confirmation dialog before deleting tasks to prevent accidental deletions.

7. *Future Features*:  
   - Add deadlines for tasks and a notification/reminder system.  
   - Sync tasks with cloud storage for access across multiple devices.
